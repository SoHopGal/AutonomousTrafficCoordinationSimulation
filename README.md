**Reservation-Based Traffic Coordination Framework (RBTCF)**

Python • Agent-Based Simulation • Traffic Coordination

## Overview

This directory contains the simulation environment developed for the Autonomous Traffic Coordination project.

The simulation models an urban traffic network with autonomous vehicles and intelligent intersections. 
The objective is to evaluate traffic coordination mechanisms and compare fixed and adaptive traffic control strategies under various traffic scenarios.

The simulator focuses on:
- Agent-based traffic coordination
- Intersection management
- Reservation-based conflict prevention
- Adaptive traffic light control
- Performance evaluation using traffic metrics

The simulator represents an abstract traffic environment and does not include real vehicle hardware or real-world sensor data.

## Implemented Control Strategies
### Fixed Traffic Light Control
A traditional traffic light mechanism:
- Green/red phases change according to a fixed time interval.
- No adaptation to current traffic conditions.

### Adaptive Traffic Light Control
A dynamic strategy:
- Green phases are selected according to current queue lengths.
- The controller prioritizes intersections with higher traffic demand.


## Features
- Agent-based traffic simulation
- Autonomous vehicle agents
- Intelligent intersection controllers
- Reservation mechanism
- Emergency priority
- Automated experiment execution
- Data export to CSV format
- Result visualization and graph generation

The simulation generates:
- Performance measurements
- Comparison results
- Visualization graphs
- Statistical summaries


## Architecture
The simulation consists of the following main components:
- **Vehicle Agent** – Handles vehicle movement, routing, and interaction with intersections.
- **Intersection Controller** – Manages traffic flow and coordination decisions.
- **Reservation Manager** – Prevents conflicts in shared intersection zones.
- **Traffic Light Controller** – Implements fixed and adaptive traffic control policies.

These components are implemented within the main simulation file (`simulation.py`).
